Generally, names of nodes will consist out of <Name> <Type> and <Number> of the object in this fashion:
<Name>_<Type>_<Number>

<Name> is written in Pascal case
<Type> is written in Pascal case and corresponds to Godot type of the node, Node2D type is never written
<Number> preferably starts with 1, if the object is the only one of this name or has some unique prefix do not write number

There are special rules governing names of the outermost nodes of the scenes and alike:

Outermost nodes always include name of the file in which the scene is stored. All "_" are replaced with "-". 
Also they should have some postfix depending on their folder:

"Templates" folder => -Template postfix
"Triggers" folder => -Trigger postfix
"UI" folder => -UI postfix
"Menu" folder => -Menu postfix
"Global" folder => -Global postfix
"Objects" folder => -Object postfix
"Scenes" folder (not Templates, just Scenes or Beggining, Chapter1, Chapter2 etc.) => -Template postfix

With postfix name of the outermost node is the following:
<Filename with "_" replace by "-"><Postfix>_<Type>_0
Where 0 is included only if this template can be used multiple times on the same scene

<Filename> is also governed by some special rules depending on the folder
In short: make filenames alike to those filenames that are already present

"Templates" folder => Mixed case (Mixed case in snake_case with First letter being capital)
"Triggers" folder => Pascal case
"UI" folder => Pascal case
"Menu" folder => Pascal case
"Global" folder => Pascal case
"Objects" folder => Pascal case
"Scenes" folder (not Templates, just Scenes or Beggining, Chapter1, Chapter2 etc.) => Mixed case (Mixed case in snake_case with First letter being capital)

Also, all proper scenes should have numbering in the beggining to indicate their order in the game



As templates and alike have some special filenames we would want to use them in every scene we build, but 
we may also want to include some extra names to indicate purpose of this template object in the scene
For example:
We have template with outermost node named "Person-Template_0"
We make NPC called "John". We want to indicate that this person is John
Therefore we write:
John;Person-Template

Where "John" is prefix

Names with prefixes are built using the following construct:
<Prefix aka "Your name">;<Name aka "Template name">_<Number>

P.S. <Number> is usually included in template name. If your prefix is unique omit it entirely, even remove one from template name

Last, but not the least: unique object
You may use some object which purpose is so clear, that they better stay unnamed
In these rare cases you are allowed to not name nodes:
*It is top-most YSort node
*It is something rare as Tween 

In all other cases you better name nodes, even if you name it like "Collider_StaticBody2D" or "Collider_CollisionShape2D". 
If it is clear to what is belongs, you are good
