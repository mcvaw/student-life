# Student Quest
A pixel art game created on the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).
We open the source code of the game so that anyone can help us with the development. It is possible you will come across a lot of bad code and even more bad sprites.
## How to open a project in editor:
0. Download this repository as a zip file and extract it or `git clone git@github.com:studentquest/game.git`
1. Download [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). It's is free and takes about 30 mb in the archive
2. Click `import` in editor and find `project.godot`
## How to play without too much effort:
Go to [itch.io](https://pixeltrain.itch.io/student-quest) and download latest version for your platform. This is not necessarily a version with all the latest changes, but we try to keep them updated.
## Branches:
There are two branches right now: `master` and `dev`. It is obvious that all the latest changes are made to the `dev` branch, and then, when it comes time to release a new version, the game is checked and the code is transferred to the `master` branch. On its basis, official versions of the game are created.
