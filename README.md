## How to play without too much effort:
Go to [itch.io](https://pixeltrain.itch.io/student-quest) and download latest version for your platform. This is not necessarily a version with all the latest changes, but we try to keep them updated.
## Branches:
There are two branches right now: `master` and `dev`. It is obvious that all the latest changes are made to the `dev` branch, and then, when it comes time to release a new version, the game is checked and the code is transferred to the `master` branch. On its basis, official versions of the game are created.
