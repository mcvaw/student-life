## How to play without too much effort
Go to [itch.io](https://pixeltrain.itch.io/student-quest) and download latest version for your platform. This is not necessarily a version with all the latest changes, but we try to keep them updated.

## Branches
There are two branches right now: `master` and `dev`. It is obvious that all the latest changes are made to the `dev` branch, and then, when it comes time to release a new version, the game is checked and the code is transferred to the `master` branch. On its basis, official versions of the game are created.

## Translation
The game's native language is Russian. We will be happy if you can help us translate the game into your language. All the files you need for translation are located in the `Translations` directory.

## License
We use GPL v3 or MIT license for all of our code, but some music and sprites don't belong to us.
We use some assets under `CC 0` and `CC BY 3.0` license.
If the license is different, there is usually a note about the license next to the file.
