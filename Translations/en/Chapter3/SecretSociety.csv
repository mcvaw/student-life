D_SS_RIVER_1,"Hey, have you lost anything? You are looking so closely."
D_SS_RIVER_2,"No, I was just thinking."
D_SS_RIVER_3,…
D_SS_RIVER_4,What are you thinking about?
D_SS_RIVER_5,It will sound pretty ridiculous.
D_SS_RIVER_6,Tell me!
D_SS_RIVER_7,"You know, there are many stories about our university."
D_SS_RIVER_8,"I'll find you in the chat, are you there?"
D_SS_RIVER_9,Yes OK.
D_SS_RIVER_10,Good night then.
THE_NEXT_DAY,The next day
EVENING,Evening
SECRET_SOCIETY,Secret Society
SS_CHAT_1,"All right, see you tomorrow"
SS_CHAT_2,"Wait, do you still remember the plan?"
SS_CHAT_3,"Yes, Yes."
D_SS_PLAN_1,"I'm sorry, can you help us find this audience?"
D_SS_PLAN_2,"All right, let me take you."
D_SS_PLAN_3,"We have such labyrinths, you can get lost."
D_SS_MESSAGE_1,"FROM: Lisa, DATE: 09.08"
D_SS_MESSAGE_2,I opened the door and returned the keys
D_SS_SECURITY_1,Thank you for helping.
D_SS_SECURITY_2,You're welcome.
D_SS_FIRE_1,We were told that the wiring might be faulty.
D_SS_FIRE_2,Lessons were canceled due to the threat of fire.
D_SS_STORE_1,I think this is a coincidence.
D_SS_STORE_2,"In your memories, the light went out before you even entered it."
D_SS_STORE_3,I still don't feel good. How could we even send her there alone?
D_SS_STORE_4,I'm scared. We should have gone straight to the basement.
D_SS_STORE_5,"Okay, maybe it's not too late. Run!"
D_SS_THOUGHTS_1,The door was closed.
D_SS_THOUGHTS_2,Nothing important was found on the computer.
D_SS_THOUGHTS_3,All in vain.
D_SS_BUS_STOP_1,"So if she doesn't show up before nightfall, they'll start a search operation?"
D_SS_BUS_STOP_2,"Yes, but it looks like our story wasn't really believed."
D_SS_BUS_STOP_3,They still have to check.
D_SS_BUS_STOP_4,Now everything has become quite strange.
D_SS_BUS_STOP_5,And what should we do now? Is there anything they can do to help?
D_SS_BUS_STOP_6,"We must believe in the best, no matter how the situation turns out."
D_SS_BUS_STOP_7,What do you think will happen next?
D_SS_BUS_STOP_8,I don’t think it’s going to get any better.
D_SS_BUS_STOP_9,"That's a pity. I'm not exactly an optimist, but it's too early to despair."
D_SS_BUS_STOP_10,I don't think I can. It was as if everything was gone in a moment. And in the future it will disappear again.
D_SS_BUS_STOP_11,Do not be discouraged. I will always be there if you need help.
