D_HP_FIELD_1,I don't remember this place.
D_HP_STREET_1,Hi.
D_HP_STREET_2,Maybe check the basement again today?
D_HP_STREET_3,I don't think it will help.
D_HP_STREET_4,I'll go all the way to the end.
D_HP_STREET_5,Hope you change your mind.
D_HP_STREET_6,I'll be waiting at 4 o'clock on the 3rd floor.

TALK,Talk
D_HP_BASEMENT_1,This computer works!
D_HP_BASEMENT_2,And what's there?
D_HP_BASEMENT_3,"I can't understand yet, everything is very strange."
D_HP_BASEMENT_4,But I'll copy everything I can.
D_HP_BASEMENT_5,"You can wait or go, like there really is nothing else."

D_HP_RIVER_1,What happened?
D_HP_RIVER_2,I was able to open some files from that computer.
D_HP_RIVER_3,"Apparently, there is something very important there."
D_HP_RIVER_4,"But the laptop suddenly turned off, and I saw the police through the window."
D_HP_RIVER_5,That's when I wrote to you.
D_HP_RIVER_6,Where did the police come from? Were they looking for me?
D_HP_RIVER_7,"I don't know, but it's best not to get caught until we figure it out."
D_HP_RIVER_8,…
D_HP_RIVER_9,What?
D_HP_RIVER_10,Do you hear footsteps? Someone is coming.
D_HP_RIVER_11,Run!
D_HP_ML_1,We split up and hid from the police all day.
D_HP_ML_2,"In the late afternoon, I went to the place where we had agreed to meet."
D_HP_MACHINE_1,Wait!
D_HP_MACHINE_2,Don't go there!
D_HP_MACHINE_3,We still don't know what's on the other side of the machine.
D_HP_MACHINE_4,And nothing ever came back.
D_HP_MACHINE_5,"I don't want to hurt you, honestly."
D_HP_MACHINE_6,But I won't let you go any further.
D_HP_MACHINE_7,No way.
D_HP_MACHINE_8,We've taken too long to get to this point.
D_HP_MACHINE_9,And we all know that there is more behind this barrier.
D_HP_MACHINE_10,I have noticed so many times how the world suddenly returned to the past.
D_HP_MACHINE_11,"This was repeated hundreds of times, and only I remembered everything."
D_HP_MACHINE_12,"Therefore, we have no way back."
D_HP_MACHINE_13,Run! I'll buy some time!
