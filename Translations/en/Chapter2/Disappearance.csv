CHECK_PHONE,Check phone
ASK_COMMANDANT,Ask the commandant
D_DSP_PHONE_1,Was online 2 hours ago…
D_DSP_COMMANDANT_1,"Excuse me, can you help?"
D_DSP_COMMANDANT_2,"I’ve lost my friend, you won’t tell me, maybe he’s in a dormitory?"
D_DSP_COMMANDANT_3,Do you know room’s number?
D_DSP_COMMANDANT_4,225
D_DSP_COMMANDANT_5,"Mmm, no, there is no one in the room 225 right now."
D_DSP_COMMANDANT_6,Okay. Thank.
D_DSP_POLICE_1,The police don't seem to help.
D_DSP_POLICE_2,They don’t even take me seriously.
D_DSP_WALK_1,"For some reason, today I really want to walk along that street."
D_DSP_THOUGHTS_1,"It feels like I've already been here, but I don’t remember when."
D_DSP_THOUGHTS_2,Although in this city all houses are so similar that it is impossible to distinguish one from another.
D_DSP_THOUGHTS_3,And why do I even go here?
D_DSP_THOUGHTS_4,But maybe there is something good in this. The New Year’s atmosphere is beautiful in its own way.
D_DSP_TALK_1,"Good evening, young man. Take a seat if you like."
D_DSP_TALK_2,You are a gardener from our university. What are you doing here?
D_DSP_TALK_3,I just enjoy the atmosphere.
D_DSP_TALK_4,So far?
D_DSP_TALK_5,I live a couple of minutes from here.
D_DSP_TALK_6,Aren't you too far to commute to work?
D_DSP_TALK_7,I don't work there. I have been retired for a long time. I just love looking after that garden. So I come every few days.
D_DSP_TALK_8,Interesting ... you live in a pretty beautiful place.
D_DSP_TALK_9,"I recently brought a bench here. Not quite myself, my friends helped me. Now it's even nicer here."
D_DSP_TALK_10,And why do you need all this?
D_DSP_TALK_11,"Just like that, I wanted to. You'd better tell me: okay, I'm already old, but why are you alone on this day? New Year is coming soon."
D_DSP_TALK_12,"I don't even know, it didn't work out, that's all. This is not my hometown, I have no friends here yet."
D_DSP_TALK_13,…
D_DSP_TALK_14,And lately I have a feeling that I have lost something important.
A_FEW_MONTHS_LATER,A few months later
D_DSP_MS_1,"You know, I'm going to leave today. It's a pity that things turned out like this."
D_DSP_MS_2,"Come to the roof of the Faculty of Geography today, please."
D_DSP_GARDENER_1,Good morning.
D_DSP_GARDENER_2,Oh good morning!
D_DSP_GARDENER_3,Did you hear that Mister Singer is leaving?
D_DSP_GARDENER_4,"No, I don't see him often, and we talk even less often."
D_DSP_GARDENER_5,So you don't know why?
D_DSP_GARDENER_6,Maybe he will tell you?
D_DSP_GARDENER_7,Maybe. Thank.
D_DSP_STRANGER_1,It's you!
D_DSP_STRANGER_2,You know me?
D_DSP_STRANGER_3,I'm sure! They told me about you!
D_DSP_STRANGER_4,Who?
D_DSP_STRANGER_5,I don't remember. But a strange feeling never leaves me.
D_DSP_STRANGER_6,What do I have to do with it?
D_DSP_STRANGER_7,"I don't know, but I'm not lying."
D_DSP_STRANGER_8,"Write me if you remember, okay? I have to run already."
D_DSP_ROOF_1,How did you get here at all?
D_DSP_ROOF_2,Is that all you care about?
D_DSP_ROOF_3,What are you talking about?
D_DSP_ROOF_4,You've given up on the search altogether. Do you need help? I believe there is something wrong here.
D_DSP_ROOF_5,Search? What are you talking about?
D_DSP_ROOF_6,Are you kidding? Don't you know about the missing girl?
D_DSP_ROOF_7,What girl?
D_DSP_ROOF_8,.. I'm sorry. I didn't want to believe it was possible until the last moment.
D_DSP_ROOF_9,Can you tell me then?
D_DSP_ROOF_10,"I'm sorry, I don't even know what to tell you."
D_DSP_ROOF_11,"Okay, I'm sorry I called you."
D_DSP_ROOF_12,Thanks!
D_DSP_NIGHT_1,I forgot.
D_DSP_NIGHT_2,I forgot everything.
D_DSP_NIGHT_3,But it doesn't happen that way.
D_DSP_NIGHT_4,But it happened.
D_DSP_BRIDGE_1,Did you remember too?
D_DSP_BRIDGE_2,Yes. What are we going to do now?
D_DSP_BRIDGE_3,I don’t understand anything.
D_DSP_BRIDGE_4,We need to calm down. Can we come to me? It's getting cold here.
D_DSP_BRIDGE_5,"O-o-okay, come on."
D_DSP_BRIDGE_6,W-w-w-what was that?
D_DSP_BRIDGE_7,"I don’t understand anything,"
D_DSP_BRIDGE_8,Hey wait!
D_DSP_BRIDGE_9,Hold on!
D_DSP_BRIDGE_10,No no!
